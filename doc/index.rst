Requirements
------------

- PHP 5.6.0 or greater
- MySQL or SQLite
- PDO/MySQL and/or PDO/SQLite

Unlike earlier versions, Amiss 5 requires PHP 5.6 or greater. If you need
support for earlier versions back to 5.3.2, use Amiss 4. Amiss 4 will be
supported for the forseeable future, but no new features will be added.

Documentation for Amiss 4 can be found here:
